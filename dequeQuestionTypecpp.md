This C++ program aims to solve a problem that involves navigating a grid from a start point ('S') to a destination ('D') while avoiding obstacles ('T'). The grid is first split into smaller sub-grids, and the sub-grids are then rearranged in different permutations to determine the shortest path between 'S' and 'D' using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Let's break down the code and explain it step by step:

---

### 1. **`findShortestPath` function**:

This function performs a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path between two points on the grid, from the start ('S') to the destination ('D').

- **Inputs**: 
  - `grid`: The main grid containing obstacles, start, and destination.
  - `N`: Size of the grid (it is assumed to be an NxN grid).
  
- **Process**:
  - The function first locates the positions of 'S' (start) and 'D' (destination) by iterating over the grid.
  - It uses a **queue** to implement BFS, where each element in the queue contains a position on the grid (`x`, `y`) and the current distance (`dist`) from the start.
  - The BFS explores in 4 directions: up, down, left, and right.
  - For each move, it checks if the new position is valid (inside the grid and not an obstacle 'T'). If the destination 'D' is found, it returns the current distance.
  - If BFS completes without finding 'D', it returns a very large value (`INT_MAX`), indicating no path was found.

### 2. **`splitGrid` function**:

This function splits the original grid into smaller sub-grids of size MxM.

- **Inputs**:
  - `grid`: The original NxN grid.
  - `N`: Size of the grid (NxN).
  - `M`: Size of each sub-grid (MxM).

- **Process**:
  - It divides the original grid into sub-grids by iterating with step size `M` both vertically and horizontally.
  - Each sub-grid is extracted and stored in a 3D vector (`subGrids`), where each element is a sub-grid.

### 3. **`assembleGrid` function**:

This function reassembles the original grid from the sub-grids in a given order.

- **Inputs**:
  - `order`: A vector containing the order in which the sub-grids should be placed.
  - `subGrids`: A vector of sub-grids that were split in the `splitGrid` function.
  - `N`: Size of the original grid.
  - `M`: Size of each sub-grid.

- **Process**:
  - It uses the `order` vector to place the sub-grids back into their correct positions in a new `grid`.
  - Each sub-grid is placed in a corresponding location, starting from the top-left corner of the grid.
  
---

### 4. **`solveProblem` function**:

This is the main function that ties everything together to solve the problem.

- **Inputs**:
  - None (it reads the grid and other inputs from `cin`).
  
- **Process**:
  - It first reads the size of the grid (`N`) and the sub-grid size (`M`).
  - Then, it reads the grid and stores it.
  - The `splitGrid` function is called to break the grid into smaller sub-grids.
  - It looks for the sub-grids that contain the start ('S') and destination ('D').
  - It creates a list of other sub-grids that are neither the start nor the destination.
  - It generates all possible permutations of the sub-grid order (excluding the start and destination sub-grids), and for each permutation:
    - It assembles the grid from the sub-grids in the current order.
    - It calculates the shortest path using `findShortestPath`.
    - It keeps track of the minimum distance found.
  - The function returns the minimum distance found, which represents the shortest path after considering all permutations of the sub-grids.

---

### 5. **`main` function**:

- **Process**:
  - It simply calls the `solveProblem` function and prints the result, which is the shortest path from 'S' to 'D'.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example where we have a 4x4 grid and sub-grids of size 2x2.

- **Grid Input**:
  ```
  S T D T
  T T T T
  T T T T
  T T T T
  ```

- **Steps**:
  1. Split the grid into 2x2 sub-grids:
     - Sub-grid 0: Contains 'S' (top-left)
     - Sub-grid 1: Contains 'D' (top-right)
     - Other sub-grids are just obstacles ('T').
  
  2. Generate permutations of the sub-grids (excluding the start and destination sub-grids).
  
  3. For each permutation, reassemble the grid and compute the shortest path using BFS.
  
  4. Find the minimum distance across all permutations.

### Key Points:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is used for finding the shortest path in the grid.
- The grid is split into smaller sub-grids, and different permutations of these sub-grids are tested to see which arrangement yields the shortest path.
- The use of `next_permutation` is crucial for testing all possible ways the sub-grids can be ordered.

This approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered, but it can be computationally expensive due to the factorial complexity of generating all permutations. Nonetheless, it provides a way to experiment with different grid arrangements in order to find the shortest path.
