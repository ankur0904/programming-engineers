ETL stands for **Extract, Transform, and Load**, and it describes the process of preparing raw data from various sources for storage and analysis in a data warehouse.

---

**Steps in the ETL Process**:
1. **Extract**:  
   - Collect data from multiple sources such as relational databases, web APIs, and flat files.
   - Handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
   - **Example**: Retrieve customer purchase data from a CRM and sales data from a POS system.

2. **Transform**:  
   - Clean and standardize the extracted data to ensure consistency.
   - Common tasks:
     - Removing duplicates.
     - Converting date formats (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY" to "YYYY-MM-DD").
     - Aggregating data (e.g., calculating total sales for each month).
   - **Example**: Convert "New York" and "NYC" to a standard value: "New York City."

3. **Load**:  
   - Store the transformed data into the data warehouse.
   - Types of loading:
     - **Full Load**: Entire dataset is overwritten.
     - **Incremental Load**: Only new or updated records are added.
   - **Example**: Load daily sales summaries into the "Sales Data" table.

---

#### **5. Explain Star, Snowflake, and Galaxy Schemas.**

Schemas are the logical structures that define how data is organized in a data warehouse.

---

**A. Star Schema**:
- **Structure**: A central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
- **Advantages**:

- **Disadvantages**:
  - Dimension tables may contain redundant data.
- **Example**:
  - **Fact Table**: "Sales" (columns: Date, ProductID, Revenue).
  - **Dimension Tables**: "Product" (columns: ProductID, Name), "Customer" (columns: CustomerID, Region).

---

**B. Snowflake Schema**:
- **Structure**: Similar to a star schema, but dimension tables are normalized (broken into smaller tables).
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces data redundancy.
  - More storage-efficient.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires more complex queries due to additional table joins.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of one "Product" table, there are two: "Product" (ProductID, CategoryID) and "Category" (CategoryID, CategoryName).

---

**C. Galaxy Schema**:
- **Structure**: Contains multiple fact tables sharing common dimension tables.
- **Advantages**:
  - Can handle complex queries and multiple processes.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More difficult to design and maintain.
- **Example**:
  - Fact Tables: "Sales" and "Returns."
  - Shared Dimension: "Product."

---

#### **6. What is the Difference Between Fact and Dimension Data?**

1. **Fact Data**:  
   - Quantitative data stored in fact tables.
   - Represents measurable business events.
   - **Examples**: Sales amount, revenue, number of products sold.

2. **Dimension Data**:  
   - Descriptive data stored in dimension tables.
   - Provides context to facts.
   - **Examples**: Product name, customer location, sales region.

**Key Difference**:
- Fact data answers "How much?" or "How many?"  
- Dimension data answers "Who?" or "What?"

---

#### **7. What is Partitioning? Explain Horizontal and Vertical Partitioning.**

**Definition**:  
Partitioning divides a database table into smaller, more manageable parts to improve query performance and simplify maintenance.

---

**Types of Partitioning**:
1. **Horizontal Partitioning**:
   - Divides rows into separate partitions based on conditions.
   - **Example**: Sales data partitioned by year: one partition for 2023 and another for 2024.
   
2. **Vertical Partitioning**:
   - Divides columns into separate tables.
   - **Example**: A "Customer" table split into "Personal Info" (Name, DOB) and "Contact Info" (Email, Phone).

Let’s expand each topic in **Unit 3: Mining Association Rules in Large Databases** with more details, examples, and formulas.  

---

### **1. Association Rule Mining**  

#### **Definition**:  
Association rule mining identifies relationships between items in large datasets. It helps businesses make data-driven decisions by revealing patterns.  

#### **Important Metrics**:  
1. **Support**: Measures how often a particular itemset appears in the dataset.

   \[\text{Support(A)} = \frac{\text{Number of transactions containing A}}{\text{Total number of transactions}}\]  
   - Example: In 100 transactions, if {bread} appears 20 times,  
     \[
     \text{Support} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \ (20\%)
     \]  

2. **Confidence**: Measures how often rule *A → B* is true.  
   \[
   \text{Confidence(A → B)} = \frac{\text{Support(A ∪ B)}}{\text{Support(A)}}
   \]  
   - Example: If 20 transactions contain {bread, butter} and 30 transactions contain {bread},  
     \[
     \text{Confidence} = \frac{20}{30} = 0.67 \ (67\%)
     \]  

3. **Lift**: Indicates how much more likely *B* is to be purchased if *A* is purchased compared to random chance.  
   \[
   \text{Lift(A → B)} = \frac{\text{Confidence(A → B)}}{\text{Support(B)}}
   \]  
   - Example: If the confidence of {bread → butter} is 0.67 and support for {butter} is 0.5,  
     \[
     \text{Lift} = \frac{0.67}{0.5} = 1.34
     \]  
   Lift > 1 indicates a strong association.  

#### **Example**:  
Dataset:  
| Transaction ID | Items Bought       |  
|----------------|--------------------|  
| T1             | Milk, Bread, Butter |  
| T2             | Milk, Bread         |  
| T3             | Bread, Butter       |  
| T4             | Milk, Butter        |  

- Rule: *Milk → Bread*  
  - Support:  
    \[
    \text{Support(Milk ∪ Bread)} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \ (50\%)
    \]  
  - Confidence:  
    \[
    \text{Confidence(Milk → Bread)} = \frac{\text{Support(Milk ∪ Bread)}}{\text{Support(Milk)}} = \frac{2}{3} = 0.67 \ (67\%)
    \]  
  - Lift:  
    \[
    \text{Lift(Milk → Bread)} = \frac{\text{Confidence(Milk → Bread)}}{\text{Support(Bread)}} = \frac{0.67}{0.75} = 0.89
    \]  

---

### **2. Single-Dimensional Boolean Association Rules**  

#### **Definition**:  
This involves a single attribute (e.g., items in a market) where the presence of an item is denoted as **true** and its absence as **false**.  

#### **Key Idea**:  
- Boolean means only two states: true or false.  
- Single-dimensional means all items belong to the same category, such as products in a store.  

#### **Example**:  
| Transaction | Milk | Bread | Butter |  
|-------------|------|-------|--------|  
| T1          | True | True  | True   |  
| T2          | True | True  | False  |  

- Rule: *If Milk → Bread*  
  - Confidence = 100% (Both transactions with Milk also have Bread).

---

### **3. Multi-Level Association Rules**  

#### **Definition**:  
Multi-level rules account for hierarchies within data, where items are grouped into categories or levels.  

#### **Example Hierarchy**:  
- **Level 1**: Beverages  
  - **Level 2**: Tea, Coffee  
    - **Level 3**: Green Tea, Black Tea  

#### **Usage**:  
- High-level rule: *If a customer buys Beverages, they are likely to buy Tea.*  
- Low-level rule: *If a customer buys Tea, they are likely to buy Green Tea.*  

#### **Support and Confidence at Different Levels**:  
- Rule: *Tea → Coffee*  
  - Level 1 (all types): Support = 40%, Confidence = 80%.  
  - Level 2 (specific types): Support = 15%, Confidence = 70%.  

---

### **4. Apriori Algorithm**  

#### **Definition**:  
An iterative approach to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules.  

#### **Steps**:  
1. **Generate Candidate Itemsets**:  
   Start with individual items and filter based on minimum support.  
2. **Prune Non-Frequent Itemsets**:  
   Combine frequent itemsets to generate larger sets.  
3. **Generate Rules**:  
   Use frequent itemsets to generate association rules that meet the confidence threshold.  

#### **Example**:  
Dataset:  
| Transaction | Items Bought       |  
|-------------|--------------------|  
| T1          | Milk, Bread, Butter |  
| T2          | Milk, Bread         |  

- Step 1: Count occurrences:  
  - {Milk}: 2, {Bread}: 2, {Milk, Bread}: 2  
- Step 2: Prune non-frequent itemsets:  
  - Keep itemsets with support > 50%.  

---

### **5. FP-Growth Algorithm**  

#### **Definition**:  
Frequent Pattern Growth compresses data into an FP-tree to avoid generating unnecessary itemsets.  

#### **Steps**:  
1. **Build an FP-Tree**:  
   - Compress transactions into a tree where each path represents itemsets.  
2. **Mine Patterns from the Tree**:  
   - Extract frequent patterns using recursive methods.  

#### **Advantages**:  
- Faster than Apriori.  
- Suitable for large datasets.  

---

### **6. Time-Series Mining Association Rules**  

#### **Definition**:  
Focuses on patterns over time.  

#### **Example**:  
- Rule: *If a product's sales increase in January, they are likely to decrease in February.*  

#### **Applications**:  
- Stock price trends.  
- Seasonal sales patterns.  

---

### **7. Latest Trends in Association Rule Mining**  

#### **Dynamic Rule Mining**:  
Rules evolve as data changes (e.g., changing shopping habits).  

#### **Big Data Integration**:  
Using tools like Hadoop or Spark for massive datasets.  

#### **Hybrid Models**:  
Combining association rules with machine learning for improved accuracy.

### **1. Classification and Distance Measures**

#### **Classification**:
- **Definition**: Classification is a supervised learning technique where the goal is to assign a label (class) to input data based on a training dataset.
- **Applications**: Email spam detection, disease diagnosis, credit risk analysis.

#### **Distance Measures**:
Distance measures are used to calculate the similarity or dissimilarity between data points, especially in clustering and classification.

1. **Euclidean Distance**:  
   \[
   d(p, q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}
   \]  
   - Example: For two points \(p = (1, 2)\) and \(q = (4, 6)\),  
     \[
     d(p, q) = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = 5
     \]  

2. **Manhattan Distance** (Taxicab Distance):  
   \[
   d(p, q) = \sum_{i=1}^n |q_i - p_i|
   \]  
   - Example: For \(p = (1, 2)\) and \(q = (4, 6)\),  
     \[
     d(p, q) = |4 - 1| + |6 - 2| = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]  

3. **Cosine Similarity**:  
   Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors:  
   \[
   \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i q_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2} \cdot \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n q_i^2}}
   \]  
   - Example: For \(p = (1, 0, -1)\) and \(q = (2, 1, -1)\),  
     \[
     \text{Similarity} = \frac{(1 \cdot 2) + (0 \cdot 1) + (-1 \cdot -1)}{\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2} \cdot \sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}}
     \]  

4. **Jaccard Index**:  
   Used for categorical data:  
   \[
   J(A, B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
   \]  
   - Example: For \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\),  
     \[
     J(A, B) = \frac{|\{2, 3\}|}{|\{1, 2, 3, 4\}|} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
     \]  

---

### **2. Clustering**

#### **Definition**:  
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity.  
- **Goal**: Maximize similarity within clusters and minimize similarity between clusters.  

#### **Types of Clustering**:
1. **Partitioning Clustering**: Divides the dataset into \(k\) non-overlapping subsets (e.g., K-Means).  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters (e.g., Agglomerative Clustering).  
3. **Density-Based Clustering**: Groups data points based on density (e.g., DBSCAN).  
4. **Model-Based Clustering**: Uses probabilistic models to form clusters (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).  

---

### **3. K-Means Algorithm**

#### **Definition**:  
A partitioning method that divides the dataset into \(k\) clusters.  

#### **Steps**:
1. **Initialize Centroids**: Randomly select \(k\) points as initial centroids.  
2. **Assign Data Points**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance measure (e.g., Euclidean).  
3. **Update Centroids**: Recalculate centroids by taking the mean of all points in each cluster.  
4. **Repeat**: Iterate steps 2 and 3 until centroids no longer change significantly.  

#### **Formula**:  
Centroid for cluster \(C_k\):  
\[
\mu_k = \frac{1}{|C_k|} \sum_{x \in C_k} x
\]  
- Example: For points \((1, 2), (2, 3)\) in cluster \(C_k\),  
  \[
  \mu_k = \left(\frac{1+2}{2}, \frac{2+3}{2}\right) = (1.5, 2.5)
  \]  

---

### **4. Decision Tree Induction**

#### **Definition**:  
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature test, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents a class label.  

#### **Steps**:
1. **Choose a Feature**: Select the best feature to split the data (e.g., using Gini Index or Information Gain).  
2. **Split the Dataset**: Divide the dataset based on the feature values.  
3. **Repeat**: Recursively build the tree until a stopping condition is met (e.g., no further splits improve classification).  

#### **Metrics**:
1. **Information Gain (IG)**:  
   \[
   IG = Entropy(\text{Parent}) - \sum_{k} \frac{|C_k|}{|C|} \cdot Entropy(C_k)
   \]  
2. **Gini Index**:  
   \[
   Gini = 1 - \sum_{k} (p_k)^2
   \]  
   - Where \(p_k\) is the proportion of samples in class \(k\).  

---

### **5. Bayesian Classification**

#### **Definition**:  
A probabilistic classification method based on Bayes’ Theorem, which predicts the likelihood of a class given the feature set.  

#### **Bayes’ Theorem**:  
\[
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}
\]  
- \(P(C|X)\): Posterior probability (probability of class \(C\) given data \(X\)).  
- \(P(X|C)\): Likelihood (probability of data \(X\) given class \(C\)).  
- \(P(C)\): Prior probability (probability of class \(C\)).  
- \(P(X)\): Evidence (probability of data \(X\)).  

#### **Example**:  
- Classes: Spam (S) and Not Spam (NS).  
- Features: Words in an email.  

If the word "cheap" appears:  
\[
P(S|cheap) = \frac{P(cheap|S) \cdot P(S)}{P(cheap)}
\]  
Using prior knowledge (word frequencies), classify the email.
