This Python code appears to solve a problem involving navigating through a grid of cells, finding the shortest path between a start ('S') and destination ('D') by considering possible permutations of smaller sub-grids (called "sheets"). The task involves partitioning the grid into smaller blocks (sheets), rearranging these blocks, and then determining the shortest path across the re-arranged grid.

Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. **Imports and Setup**
```python
from collections import deque
import itertools
```
- `deque` from `collections` is a double-ended queue used for efficient pops from the front and appends to the back.
- `itertools` provides the `permutations` function for generating permutations of a list.

### 2. **`gsp(foo, N)` Function**
This function computes the shortest path using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on the grid `foo`.

#### Parameters:
- `foo`: 2D list representing the grid (e.g., the maze or map).
- `N`: Size of the grid (assumed to be an `N x N` grid).

#### Explanation:
- It first searches the grid for the starting point `'S'` and destination point `'D'`.
- A queue is initialized with the starting position and a distance of `0`.
- A `visited` set is used to avoid re-visiting positions.
- BFS is used to explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from the current position.
- For each valid neighbor (within bounds and not blocked by a wall `'T'`), it is added to the queue with an incremented distance.
- If the destination `'D'` is reached, the current distance is returned.
- If no path exists, it returns `float('inf')` to indicate that it's unreachable.

### 3. **`getSh(foo, N, M)` Function**
This function divides the grid `foo` into smaller blocks (called "sheets").

#### Parameters:
- `foo`: The grid to be split.
- `N`: Size of the grid (assumed `N x N`).
- `M`: Size of each block (sheet). Each sheet is an `M x M` block.

#### Explanation:
- The function iterates over the grid in steps of `M` and collects `M x M` sub-grids (sheets).
- The result is a list `shts` containing all the sheets from the grid.

### 4. **`makeGr(arrNT, shts, N, M)` Function**
This function reconstructs the grid by re-arranging the smaller sheets in a specific order.

#### Parameters:
- `arrNT`: A list of sheet indices that specifies the order in which the sheets should be placed.
- `shts`: The list of sheets.
- `N`: Size of the grid.
- `M`: Size of each sheet.

#### Explanation:
- The function initializes an empty grid `foo` of size `N x N`.
- It then places each sheet from `shts` into the grid at the correct position based on the `arrNT` list, which specifies where each sheet should go.
- The result is the re-arranged grid.

### 5. **`solve()` Function**
This is the main function that solves the problem.

#### Explanation:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the grid dimensions (`N` and `M`) and the grid itself.
   - The grid is a list of strings (each representing a row of the grid).
   
2. **Splitting the Grid into Sheets:**
   - `getSh` is called to split the grid into `M x M` sheets.
   - `numSht` is the total number of sheets, which is calculated as `(N // M) ** 2`.
   
3. **Identifying the Start and Destination:**
   - The function iterates through the sheets to find which sheets contain the start ('S') and destination ('D') points.
   - The start sheet (`sst`) and destination sheet (`dst`) are recorded.

4. **Generating Permutations:**
   - The remaining sheets (excluding the start and destination sheets) are permuted using `itertools.permutations`.
   - Each permutation of the sheets is tested to find the best order in which to arrange the sheets.

5. **Reconstructing the Grid:**
   - For each permutation of sheets (`arrNT`), the function uses `makeGr` to reconstruct the grid with the new arrangement of sheets.
   
6. **Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - The `gsp` function is called on the reconstructed grid to compute the shortest path from the start to the destination.
   - The minimum distance across all permutations is tracked.

7. **Return the Result:**
   - After testing all permutations, the minimum distance is returned.

### 6. **Main Block**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(solve())
```
- This block calls the `solve()` function and prints the result when the script is executed.

### Example Walkthrough

Letâ€™s assume we have a `5x5` grid and we want to divide it into `2x2` sheets:

#### Input:
```
N = 5, M = 2
Grid:
S . . . .
. T T T .
. T D T .
. . . . .
. . . . .
```

- The grid will be divided into 4 `2x2` sheets.
- The goal is to rearrange the sheets and find the shortest path from `S` to `D`.

The code will:
- Split the grid into sheets.
- Try all permutations of sheet orders (skipping the start and destination sheets).
- Reconstruct the grid for each permutation and compute the shortest path.
- Return the minimum path distance.
